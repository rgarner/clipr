# Clipr

An incomplete utility to takes Garmin .tcx files and clip the ends past a certain point, recalculating averages as it
goes.

I made this because I'm sick of one of the following two things happening:

1. I finish a ride but forget to hit stop, and my average speed goes down as I pootle around recovering with the Garmin in my pocket
1. I finish a ride and hit stop, but forget to reset/turn it off and hit the start button again while pootling around recovering with the Garmin in my pocket.
